# Introduction
I was tasked with creating a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with Java and NetBeans IDE for my midterm project in my Computer Science 221 class (Fall 2015).  I practiced using random number generators as a basic form of AI, and practiced using arrays to store and modify the game board.

# Basic Overview
The user is first asked to input the position they would like to mark.  After putting a mark on the board, the computer generates a random number and places their mark on the board.  The user is then asked again to mark the board.  This pattern continues until a draw is reached or either the player or computer wins the game.
